- Glasses show characteristics of both crystals and liquids 
- Glass can be considered a class of matter
    - glasses lack periodic order of atoms, ions, or molecules
    - do not have a sharp melting point 
    - are considered non-crystalline solids 
    - have elasticity (like crystalline solids), can flow like liquids
        - combination of "short time" rigidity (of crystalline state) and long time fluidity (of liquid state)

- Glasses are not usually naturally occuring 
- Glass formation 
    - formed by undercooling a liquid below its freezing point to a rigid condition (without crystillization)
    - can also be formed by compressing a liquid 
        - Can find the pressure at which the glass transition occurs

Glucose example 
- you can undercool glucose to form a glass 
- when the melted state of glucose is cooled below room temp 
    - glass transition occurs at some point
    - at this glassy state, its expansivity and heat capacity are like crystalline glucose but its volume and heat content are similar to liquid glucose 

Genetic Definition of Glassy State: maintins energy, volume, and structure of liquid but changed in energy and volume with temperature and pressure similar in magnitude to those of the crystalline solid

- Thermodynamic aspects 
    - glass transition mimics the characteristics of a second-order thermodynamic transition
    - do not obey third law of thermodynamics --> entropy of a glass doesn't vanish at absolute zero
    - applying pressure to a liquid increases the glass transition temperature

- Metastability, Non-Crystalline Solids and Glasses
    - glassy states are an example of how matter can exist in metastable state
        - these objects are in a higher free energy than the stable state


Data 
- take trajectory of a particle in a glass 
    - take a small part of the trajectory (split it in half)
    - see how far each point in the first half is from the average of the second half (and visa versa)
    - slide the window across the entire trajectory 
    - the function Phop is very big when there is a change in the trajectory (small otherwise)
    - the output is +1 when the particle is rearranging and -1 when the particle is not rearranging
- the local environment around that particle is represented by the vector of 100 numbers 
- neural network tries to predict the probability of the particle rearranging
