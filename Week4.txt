1. I went through the SGD and backprop python code to further understand how it works. My work for this is under the file
    analyzing_SGD.py. I wrote comments throughout the code so that I could better follow it. 
2. I implemented a small learning network for sin(x) and plotted my results. My work is under neural-networks --> src --> testing.ipynb.
